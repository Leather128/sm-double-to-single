# sm-double-to-single

Just a simple python script to convert `dance-double` charts to `dance-single` cuz I wanted to play ballistic remix on `dance-single` lol.

# Requriements:

- A pc with Python 3 installed (v3.10.2 was used for testing, but other ones should work)

- The simfile python library (can be installed with `pip install simfile` or `pip3 install simfile`)

# Running

Just run main.py and paste the file path to the StepMania file you want to convert (can be either .sm or .ssc I think, although only .sm was tested).

Then press enter to convert. (it should make a .old file containing the original data in the same directory just in case anything goes wrong in the conversion, which it shouldn't).
